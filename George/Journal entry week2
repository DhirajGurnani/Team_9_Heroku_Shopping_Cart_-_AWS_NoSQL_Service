Journal entry for week 2

This weekâ€™s work focuses mainly on the extra credit presentation for which we have used couch DB. The preparation for the presentation also gives us an insight into how couch DB would come into play for the final project. We have completed the queries of couch DB which is a document oriented database where data is stored in the form of JSON documents. These documents are uniquely identified by an ID. Each document takes in data in the JSON format and when the document is finally created, a revision ID is attached to it. This revision ID is very handy during replication scenarios. Documents can be created on the command line utility using the CURL command. However using the futon UI makes it very easy to implement the CRUD in couch DB. Also successfully completed and demonstrated the map and reduce operations on existing documents by using basic Javascript code snippets. The map and reduce operations help to display a view of the document in an organized and structured manner where map displays the document as it is and the reduce function allows us to have a more specific view of the document- (eg- sum function to group values). Finally we also run the concept of replication where the couch DB replicator allows us to replicate documents locally or to remote databases (by specifying the remote URL). Also we experiment with the concept of conflict resolution where we see the databases replicate based on the latest revision numbers which are auto assigned during document creation and updating.
