Journal Entry- Week 3

This Week primarily began with the creation of individual front end api’s by some team members and simultaneous work on the backend api’s
by the other members. This was first commenced with the creation of a wireframe diagram of the system’s different web pages. 
After these diagrams, I started working on the backend api for retrieving the orders from the couch DB document. 
This demo code for this api was successfully tested on the local system and will be merged soon once the system is moved to AWS. 
The same case follows for the “Cancel Orders api which was successfully created and tested locally. 
The week finally ended with a scrum meeting where I designed a flowchart which accurately represents how the flow of information 
would take place throughout the system. The meeting also highlighted the structures of the various databases which will be 
created in couch DB and the documents which will be associated with the same. Also discussed were the common files and boostraps 
which will be required for individuals to develop a coherent UI. On the whole we have now successfully defined the structures for 
various components of the application as well as started to assemble the various bits and pieces together. All of this data is 
committed to Git and now  work will progress towards linking the backend to the frontend UI for individual pages.
